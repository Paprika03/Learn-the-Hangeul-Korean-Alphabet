HANGEUL LEARNING GAME

This project is a simple web game designed to help memorize the Korean alphabet (Hangeul) in an interactive way. It is built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

FEATURES

The game includes three different modes for practice:

1.  **Memory**: A classic pair-matching game to associate Hangeul characters with their sound (romanization).
2.  **Flash Quiz**: A fast-paced mode to test your character recognition speed.
3.  **Syllable Builder**: A mode to practice combining consonants and vowels to form basic syllable blocks.
