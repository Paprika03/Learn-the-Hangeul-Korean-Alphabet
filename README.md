HOW IT WORKS

This is a simple game built to answer life's most important questions.

1.  The game fetches the "entire" champion list from the Riot Data Dragon API.
2.  It shuffles the list.
3.  You are presented with one champion at a time.
4.  You make your choice:  ""Smash" or "Pass".
5.  At the end, you see your total "Smash" count.
6.  Judge again!

TECH STACK

This project is pure, vanilla web tech. No frameworks, no fuss.

HTML5: For the game structure.
CSS3: For all the styling, animations, and that "looks-like-LoL" feel.
JavaScript (ES6+):** For all the game logic, randomization, and `async/await` calls to the Data Dragon API.
